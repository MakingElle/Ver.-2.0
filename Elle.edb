Our wassail cup is made Of the rosemary tree, And so is your beer Of the best       barley. We are not daily beggars That beg from door to door; But we are         neighbours' children, Whom you have seen before. Call up the butler of this     house, Put on his golden ring. Let him bring us up a glass of beer, And better  we shall sing.

Bring us out a table And spread it with a cloth;  Bring us out a mouldy cheese, And some of your Christmas loaf. God bless the    master of this house Likewise the mistress too, And all the little children That round the table go. Good master and good mistress, While you're sitting by the fire, Pray think of us poor children Who are wandering in the mire.
