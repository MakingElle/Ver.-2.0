For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. For he that is mighty   hath done to me great things; and holy is his name. And his mercy is on them    that fear him from generation to generation. He hath shewed strength with his   arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree. He hath      filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away. He    hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy. — Luke 1:46-54

And now, O      Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have   kept thy word. Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me  are of thee. For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and   they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and   they have believed that thou didst send me. — John 17:1-8
