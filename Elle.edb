I bind unto myself today, the power of God to hold and lead, his eye to watch,  his might to stay, his ear to harken to my need: the wisdom of my God to teach, his hand to guide, his shield to ward; the word of God to give me speech, his   heavenly host to be my guard. Christ be with me, Christ within me, Christ behind me, Christ before me, Christ beside me, Christ to win me, Christ to comfort and restore me. Christ beneath me, Christ above me, Christ in quiet, Christ in     danger, Christ in hearts of all that love me, Christ in mouth of friend and     stranger.

O Thou, who only hast power to do these things and more        abundant good with us, we praise Thee through the High Priest and Guardian of   our souls Jesus Christ, through whom be glory and majesty to Thee both now and  from generation to generation and forevermore.
